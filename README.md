## ROBOT RECIPES

Recently I heard about RobotFramework, a framework for test automation and Robotic Process Automation.
The last one, RPA I find it pretty cool and I decided to give it a try.

I have a small business, a bakery to be more precise. One of the things that I wanted to automate as a first start 
is find the recipes and 
do the budget in order to set a price.
