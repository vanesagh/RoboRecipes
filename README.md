## ROBOT RECIPES

Recently I heard about RobotFramework, a framework for test automation and Robotic Process Automation (RPA).
The last one, RPA, I find it pretty cool and super useful, so I decided to give it a try.

I have a small business, a bakery to be more precise. One of the things that I wanted to automate as a first start
is find the recipes and
do the Bill of Materials in order to set a price.
